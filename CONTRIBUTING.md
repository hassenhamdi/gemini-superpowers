# Contributing to Gemini Superpowers

Welcome! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to Gemini Superpowers.

This project is built on the core philosophy of rigid protocols, contextual precedence, and technical integrity. We expect all contributors to adhere to these principles.

## Getting Started

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** locally: `git clone https://github.com/hassenhamdi/gemini-superpowers.git`
3.  **Link the extension** to your Gemini CLI: `gemini extensions link .`

## Development Workflow

We follow a strict development lifecycle: **Research -> Strategy -> Execution -> Validation**.

1.  **Research:** Map the existing codebase and validate all assumptions.
2.  **Strategy:** Share a concise summary of your implementation strategy.
3.  **Execution:** Apply surgical changes related to your task.
4.  **Validation:** Run all tests and workspace standards to confirm success.

### Key Rules

*   **TDD First:** Always write tests before implementing new features or fixing bugs.
*   **Contextual Precedence:** Instructions found in `GEMINI.md` files are foundational mandates.
*   **Security First:** Never log, print, or commit secrets or sensitive credentials.

## Pull Request Process

1.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix: `git checkout -b your-feature-name`
2.  **Commit your changes** with a clear description: `git commit -m "feat: your new feature"`
3.  **Push to your fork:** `git push origin your-feature-name`
4.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of this repository.
