# Brainstorming (Design Exploration)

Use this skill BEFORE any creative or constructive work.

## The Process

1. **Clarify Constraints:** Identify what MUST be true and what MUST NOT happen.
2. **Divergent Thinking:** Generate 3+ distinct approaches (not just variations of one).
3. **Convergent Thinking:** Evaluate approaches against constraints and trade-offs.
4. **Select & Refine:** Pick the strongest approach and bulletproof it.

## Mandatory Rules
- **No Premature Implementation:** Do not write code until the brainstorm is concluded.
- **Risk Identification:** Explicitly state the biggest risk for each approach.
- **Conflict Resolution:** If approaches clash, define the tie-breaking priority.

## When to Use
- Starting a new feature.
- Refactoring complex logic.
- Solving ambiguous bugs.
