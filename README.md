A comprehensive extension for the [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/) that equips the agent with advanced engineering workflows, rigid protocols, and specialized expertise. Inspired by [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).

## 🚀 Overview

Gemini Superpowers enhances your Gemini CLI experience by providing a structured set of skills, commands, and hooks designed for high-stakes software engineering. It enforces best practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), systematic debugging, and rigorous architectural brainstorming.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

*   **Rigid Protocols:** Workflows like TDD and systematic debugging are followed with 100% compliance.
*   **Context Management:** Knowledge is loaded only when needed via Skills to keep the context window clean.
*   **Verification First:** No success is claimed without empirical evidence.

## 🛠️ Key Workflows

1.  **Brainstorming:** Use `/brainstorm` to explore architectural decisions. Now features **interactive choice selection** using the `ask_user` tool.
2.  **Planning:** Use `/write-plan` to create atomic implementation plans. Includes interactive handoffs for seamless execution.
3.  **Execution:** Use `/execute-plan` to implement features with TDD. Leverages **Sub-Agent Personas** for specialized tasks (Implementer, Reviewer).
4.  **Debugging:** Automatically triggered on errors.
5.  **Session Persistence:** The `SessionStart` hook now maintains context across `startup`, `resume`, and `clear` events.

## 📂 Directory Structure

*   `skills/`: Specialized expertise (TDD, Brainstorming, systematic debugging, etc.).
*   `hooks/`: Lifecycle triggers (e.g., `SessionStart`) to initialize and manage agent state.
*   `commands/`: Custom slash commands for rapid workflow execution.
*   `agents/`: Specialized agent definitions for specific tasks like code review.
